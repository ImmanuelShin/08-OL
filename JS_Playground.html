The reason they want it gone is because of an agreement MLB has with the umpires that states "interactions with microphone wearing umpires would never be made public" - this video breaks that agreement and is also why you don't see videos with umpire audio very often. The rule was part of the umpires' collective bargaining agreement contracts, which went into effect back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table."</p>

                        <p>"For anyone not up to date on this reference: From the beginning of episode two onwards of the Mr Bean series, Mr. Bean falls from the sky to the ground into a beam of spotlight just like this. The funniest part about this though is that as Mr. Bean falls, a choir starts to sing out the line ‘Ecce homo qui est faba’, which roughly translates to: "In nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table."</p>

                        <p>"My wife is a body language expert and enjoys analyzing Melania's posture a little too much. Usually Melania keeps her shoulders forward and down, almost as if she's slouching, and tends to keep her arms perfectly stiff at her sides. Experts refer to this as "a danger response" which means the person is freezing in place while bringing their limbs closer to their body — sort of hunkering down in place. The idea behind "the danger response" is to make yourself seem small. The pose has become almost exclusively associated with the first lady - so much so that a lot of people who study body language refer to it as "The Melania." It's also important to note however that Melania did not always act this way. Her demeanor has changed significantly since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

We were around 31,000 feet on a climb toward 38,000 when I heard a loud pop which was followed by a sort of quiet rushing sound. I looked out the window and saw the right engine was failing and basically shooting out shards of metal like bullets. The cowling of the engine had started to peel back like a banana - I looked over at the lady sitting next to me and calmly told her that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

                        <p>"I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion here but as someone who has dealt with neighbors that party excessively it's not all fun and games. My wife and I purchased a house outside of Portland, Oregon in the late 90s not knowing we were moving next door to a "party house." The parties would consistently go on until 3 or 4am and our property was frequently vandalized. We filed dozens of police reports (other neighbors did as well) but nothing was ever done to help fix the situation. We finally decided to cut our losses and move out back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

                        <p>"For those seeking an explanation on this: "Laminar Flow" is a flow which has very little lateral mixing - the material flows perfectly 'in layers' as opposed to what is known as turbulent mixing. Picture an 8 lane freeway that is packed with traffic. If everyone stays in their lanes then the entire procession can move forward without any problems. This would be considered laminar flow. If everyone starts to change lanes this would slow things down and could be considered turbulent flow. Unfortunately, humans love to switch lanes as it makes us feel like we felt back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

The Kwangbok Department Store in Pyongyang will allow you to exchange your foreign currency into North Korean won so you can spend it in their store - However, this department store is the only place in the area that you can actually use the currency. You can also get DPRK won if you visit "Rason" - also known as the "Special Economic Zone." Rason is in the northeast corner of the country and shares borders with both China and Russia. Visitors have been able to buy and spend DPRK won freely in the economic zone since at least nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

While this concept isn't exactly "new" the buildings popping out to become a leg is something I haven't seen before. You might want to look into selling these as the hidden furniture market is as hot as it's been since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>

Now, if they came up with a bad attitude complaining to me about how expensive the drinks were to start with and that they should automatically be entitled to free refills then they were on their own. I had one super entitled woman have an absolute meltdown because I ignored her repeated demands that I refill her diet coke - security actually had to intervene and calmly explain to her how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table."</p>
